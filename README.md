# Uncommon Python Error: Masked ZeroDivisionError
This repository demonstrates a Python code snippet that exhibits a less common type of error handling problem.  The code contains a `ZeroDivisionError` which is conditionally masked. This type of error can be hard to find since it only occurs under specific conditions. The solution provides enhanced error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.  The files are:

- `bug.py`: Python code demonstrating the error.
- `bugSolution.py`: Python code that solves the issue with enhanced error handling.
